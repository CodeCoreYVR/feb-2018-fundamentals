// we're declaring a variable named `luckyNumber` that holds the value 13
let luckyNumber = 13;
let name = 'John';
const result = true;

// Notes about variables:
// 1. we use let when we expect the value of the variable to change later
// 2. we use const when we don't expect the  value of the variable to change
// 3. you can't redeclare a variable with let or const after your declared it
// 4. Variables names can't start with a number but can have a number later
// 5. You can't have spaces or special character in them except for _ or $
// 6. although not enforced, it's highly encouraged to use camelCase naming
//    convetion

let firstName = 'Tam'; // this follow camel case convention
// ones below don't follow naming convention:
let firstname = 'Tam';
let first_name = 'Tam';
let first_Name = 'Tam';
